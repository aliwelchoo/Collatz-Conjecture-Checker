# Collatz-Conjecture-Checker

This is a project to check for loops in the problem formulated in the Collatz Conjecture.

You can check for loops of a specific length or continuosly search the tree of all length loops until a solution is found

The solution is at least O(2^n) where n is the length of the loop so is not quick.
But the intention is to find a way to check all loops of a set length rather than check a single number at a time
